# Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project demonstrates the use of **K-Means Clustering** for customer segmentation based on purchasing behavior. By clustering similar customers, businesses can implement targeted marketing strategies, recommend products, and improve customer retention.

## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains the dataset (`customers.csv`) used for training.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks with exploratory data analysis and clustering implementation.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for data preprocessing, clustering, and analysis.
- **reports/**: Project report and visualizations for presentation.

## Key Concepts

- **K-Means Clustering**: An unsupervised algorithm that partitions data into clusters based on similarity.
- **Elbow Method**: Used to determine the optimal number of clusters.
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Dimensionality reduction technique to visualize high-dimensional data.

## Installation and Usage

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/customer-segmentation-kmeans.git
